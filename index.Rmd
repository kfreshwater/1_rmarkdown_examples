# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**


## Site Description

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



# Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 



## DyGraph example. 

```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 1.6)
```

## Poudre Paragraph

The **Poudre River** is a [National Heritage Area](https://www.nps.gov/places/cache-la-poudre-river-national-heritage-area.htm) located in the state of Colorado, originally designated in 2009. The river begins in Rocky Mountain National Park, before joining with the South Platte River east of Greeley, Colorado. Over *half a million residents* in Northern Colorado depend on the water supplied by the Poudre River. The [National Water Quality Council](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/provider/NWIS/USGS-CO/USGS-06752260/) tracks USGS stations monitoring hydrologic conditions; on the National Water Quality Council's website, station data can be isolated from the beginning of the Poudre River, all the way to the South Platte's--and resulting Platte's--conjunction to the Missippi River. **Looking just Fort Collins**, there are a high concentration of USGS stations along the path of the river. [Fort Collins Utilities](https://www.fcgov.com/utilities/what-we-do/water/water-treatment/) works hard to ensure that residents in the city will have clean, drinkable water; although not all water comes from tin 2020, it was estimated that facilities treat *23 million gallons of water* a day. The city doesn't solely rely on the South Platte River, of course; during wildfire runoff events that increases sediment levels **above**$ capacity limits, [Fort Collins relies more heavily on water from Horsetooth Reservoir](https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2021/04/28/fort-collins-water-shortage-watch-due-cameron-peak-fire-impacts/4861897001/).
